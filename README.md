## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Requires Python ‚â•3.10 and PyTorch. Create a fresh env, install PyTorch that matches your CUDA, then install the repo requirements.

```
# fresh environment
conda create -y -n so python=3.11
conda activate so

# install PyTorch first (choose the right CUDA build from pytorch.org)
# example for CUDA 12.4 wheels:
pip install torch==2.4.0+cu124 torchvision==0.19.0+cu124 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# now install project deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt is intentionally small and only contains what the code actually uses (PyTorch/vision, numpy/scipy, Pillow, tqdm, ftfy, regex, gdown).
```
